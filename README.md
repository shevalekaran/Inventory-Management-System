Setup the development environment
Open NetBeans IDE and create a new Java project with the name InventoryApp. Now create a new package with the name inventoryapp. Inside the inventoryapp package, we will create all the Java files. 
Make sure you have MySQL server and Workbench installed on your system. If not then follow this.
Download the MySQL Connector jar file. Now we need to add the dependencies of the project.
Expand the project and right-click on libraries, click on add jar/folder and browse the jar file you have downloaded from above and add it here.
